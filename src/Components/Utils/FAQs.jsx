      content: `This is a massive advantage of FLOH compared to other crypto projects. Halloween Floki, like every coin on the market, might fluctuate in value a lot. In contrast, BUSD is very stable, almost 1:1 to USD, which in result, reduces the risk of your investment. With decent volume, your investment will pay for itself over time.`,
